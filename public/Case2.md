Next, we will introduce Revelio through a caseï¼š

We import an SVG about the exoplanet discovery map into the SVG Editor. Our task is improve the green habitable planets zone.

Then, Revelio perceives the Perception scop and obtains Patterns list.

We can found the initial few patterns did not have task patterns. 

So we continued scrolling through...... (scrolling)

We discovered a hybrid pattern containing green background ring, the task pattern and an extension pattern with legend dot. 

Through analyzing visual effect distribution and visual salience......(click the three patterns one by one)

We concluded that while the extensive green background effectively delineates habitable zones, it might potentially diminish the information prominence of the exoplanets themselves.

Next, we select the task pattern, check the encoding usage in the visual encodings assessment and obtain improving suggestions.

Revelio has given suggestions to modify the stroke-width and stroke color based on the usage of encodings.

we decide to keep the green fill of the dots unchanged to accurately convey the characteristics of the habitable zone, but increase the stroke width to 3 pixels. 

As a result, the salience of the task pattern has been significantly improved. 

And then, we consider that the stroke color can be custom-modified to form a halo effect, thereby making the habitable zone planets more eye-catching and beautiful.

So far, after several simple operations, we have completed the task.
